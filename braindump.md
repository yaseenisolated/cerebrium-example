Objective:

Build *something* on cerebrium. Has to be deployed with a Dockerfile. 

Potentially something using AI? Doesn't seem to be a requirement.

What is available on cerebrium:
- GPU access. 
- Arbitrary compute
- Secrets
- Volumes, unclear if this necessarily works with dockerfile stuff


What can I do in 3 hours?
- Multiplayer tic-tac-toe just to run *some* app. State management will possibly be tricky. I suspect that volumes + custom dockerfiles may be a bit fiddly.
- Fun image generation app (AI something?). 
  - Upload image of yourself and get a cartoonified thing?
  - News of the day image. Download some dumps of frontpage news and then do some image generation to do some cartoonification of it? Would be cool to wake up with a new background photo every day.
  - Pull your GOogle Photos for the week and summarise it all up for you with a post? That would be cool.
- Real-time voice interaction with my Obsidian notes? Transcription + lookup would be insanely cool. Very jarvisy.


I think i'm going to do the news of the day thing because it has nice and limited scope.

I haven't written any python in maybe 10 years so this may be a bit tricky but we can get it to work!
